===============================================


Once you have received the I-20/DS-2019 from the school of your choice, you can start to apply for the student visa. Make sure all of the information on your I-20 is correct. If anything information on your I-20 is wrong, please contact the international student office to request a new copy of the I-20. There are two types of visas for international students studying in United States; F-1 and J-1. Most international student will hold F-1 visa. The differences between these two visas are quite significant, which will be explained in another post. For now, you donâ€™t have to worry about it.  In short, if you are given a I-20, that is for the F-1 visa meanwhile if you are given DS-2019, that is for the J-1 visa. 

Follow these basic steps . Each step is described in greater detail below

- Pay the SEVIS Fee
- Prepare a digital photo of 2 x 2 inches (51 x 51 mm)
- Fill out the DS-160 form
- Pay the visa fee 
- Schedule an appointment for the embassy interview
- Wait for the visa approval.
